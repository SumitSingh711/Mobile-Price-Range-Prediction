In this project, I focused on predicting the price range of mobile phones based on a diverse set of features extracted from mobile data.

The goal was to categorize phones into one of four distinct price ranges: **low cost, medium cost, high cost, and very high cost**.
To achieve this, I employed a systematic approach that involved several critical steps.

First, I explored and preprocessed the data, ensuring that all features were appropriately scaled and encoded for modeling. 
I then applied various classification algorithms to identify the most effective one for this task. 
This process included evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, as well as performing cross-validation to ensure robustness.

After selecting the best-performing algorithm, I deployed the model on a server using Streamlit, creating an interactive web application where users can input mobile specifications and receive real-time price range predictions. Link for the web application is in top.

This end-to-end approach not only highlights the effectiveness of different algorithms but also demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in real-world scenarios.
